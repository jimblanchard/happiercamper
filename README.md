# Welcome to my Happier Camper HC1

We have a 2021 Happier Camper HC1. It is beloved. It is also a little bewildering at times. A thing that I didn't quite appreciate when we purchased it is that anything that is relatively low volume is essentially a kit project for the manufacturer. Parts go in and out of stock with their distributors over time. The manufacturer finds better and/or less expensive ways of doing things. Quality control can be, regrettably, a little uneven.

I can't complain. The Happier Camper is a unique product that aims really high. Tons of features, clever design, and light enough to be pulled by many passenger cars in the US. I've yet to see an alternative that we would enjoy using as much as our HC1.

## What am I doing here

Documentation! These trailers aren't like a car where you get this big, thick manual that tells you everything from how to insert the key to turn it on to which fuse protects the 12v DC socket in the back seat. Never mind being able to purchase a repair manual or something. It's really sparsely documented in comparison.

I decided that, for my own sanity, I wanted to come up with documentation to make it easier for me to maintain my trailer over time. That meant writing everything down that I figured out so I didn't have to figure it out again.

## Disclaimer

This is pretty important. What follows is what I've found in my trailer. Yours, dear reader, could easily be different in key places. Mine was manufactured in late 2021. If yours is a different year, it's likely different. You might have different factory options. They might have attached the purple wire to a different light. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

The point is, use this with caution if you are examining your own trailer.
