# Overview

Our trailer came with a GoPower solar connector on the street side of the trailer. GoPower calls the [Solar On The Side](https://gopowersolar.com/solar-on-the-side/). There are a couple of things to note here.

## Polarity is reversed

The connector is a [standard SAE DC power connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_connector#/media/File:SAE_Connector.png). However, the polarity is reversed from what the SAE standard would suggest. It turns out that this is done on purpose and for good reasons. Imagine you hook up your solar panels to the extension wiring and are standing next to the trailer. If the wiring were SAE standard, the male terminal on the wire you are holding would be the positive terminal. If you touched it, you could be badly hurt.

GoPower and Zamp both reverse the polarity so this doesn't happen. The positive terminal is female, making the wire much safer to handle. I purchased an adapter kit on Amazon, making sure that the wire guage was thick enough for the solar array I was using.

## A solar charge controller is required

The wiring from the port on the side of the trailer is directly connected to my battery. It actually goes through a bus bar system, but electrically it's the same as being directly connected. My battery is a simple 100 amp-hour lead acid battery. It wants to charge at between 13.5 and 14 volts. Any reasonably-sized suitcase solar array is going to put out a lot more voltage than that. If I just plug the panels directly into the port, I'm going to fry my battery. Dangerous.

In order to safely use the solar array, I need to purchase a solar charge controller that can work with a 12 volt battery system. This device steps down the voltage to the right range so that I can safely charge my battery.

There are a range of options available. Some external solar arrays come with one built in, which is convenient but can be more expensive than buying a separate one that is wired inline between the panels and the trailer.

There are also internal ones that offer a ton of features that is installed inside the trailer between the GoPower connector and the bus bars. Doing this would void the warranty if it is still in effect.
