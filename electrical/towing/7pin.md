# Overview

The 7 pin wiring harness that runs to the tow vehicle doesn't use the standard set of wire colors that any of the specs call for. This, apparently, is normal. "Specification" in this application means "Do it this way unless you decide to do something totally different which is fine too." You have to look at what they actually did on your trailer to really know. This is how mine was set up...

## Using the Hopkins wiring diagrams

Hopkins ditches wire colors on their connector hardware in favor of a 2 letter code that describes what that blade is supposed to be for. Given that the wire color codes are totally unreliable, this makes sense. Hopkins provides nice diagrams on their website [here](https://hopkinstowingsolutions.com/support/wiring-guides.html).

The trailer-side SAE Standard diagram is the correct one to refer to here. That accurately reflected how the wire harness was connected, though the wire colors were different.

## Our HC1

Everything assumes that you have taken apart the trailer-side connector and are looking at the screw terminals where the wire harness wires will attach.

Clockwise from the top:

| 2 Letter Code | Description | My HC1 Wire Color |
|--|--|--|
| AX | Auxiliary | Red |
| RT | Right Turn | Green |
| EB | Electric Brake | Black |
| GD | Ground | White |
| LT | Left Turn | Yellow |
| TM | Taillight | Brown |

The 7th wire in the harness is blue, and is **not** connected to the center terminal on the 7 pin blade connector. Our HC1 does not have backup lights, so that makes some sense.
