# Overview

The power converter handles all the distribution of DC and AC loads throughout the trailer. It's the thing that has the breakers and fused in it at the front of the HC1. Our trailer came equipped with a Progressive Dynamics PD4060K.

## Documentation

When you go to the [Progressive Dynamics website](https://www.progressivedyn.com/support-manuals-troubleshooting-guides/) you want to look for the PD4060, ignore the K. There are two models, the 4060 and the 4060LIK. The LIK is for LiFePO4 batteries only. The regular 4060 can do either lead acid or lithium.
