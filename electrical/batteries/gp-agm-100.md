# Go Power GP-AGM-100

The stock battery that came with the trailer is a GP-AGM-100.

## Solar Controller Settings

I contacted Go Power when looking in to the correct configuration settings for a solar charge controller to use when charging this battery. I received the following:

| Setting | Value |
|--|--|
| Absorption Voltage | 14 |
| Float Voltage | 13.4 |
| Equalization Voltage | Not Used Set low 12-13 vdc |
| Automatic Equalization | Disabled |
| Maximum Absorption Time | 12 h |
| Temperature Compensation mV/degC | Take the default |

As this is a single battery system, it makes sense that all the equalization features and voltages be disabled. You'd never try to equalize.
